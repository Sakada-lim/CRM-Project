# Bold_Vision_CRM (clean starter)

Minimal Vue 3 + Vite starter with Vue Router and Pinia enabled, stripped of all demo components and styles.

## Get started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Notes

- App is intentionally blank: `App.vue` renders only `<RouterView />` and `HomeView` shows a placeholder heading.
- Pinia is registered but no stores are present. Create new stores in `src/stores/` as needed.
- Default styles removed. Add your own styles and components as you build features.
